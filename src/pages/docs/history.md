# Hello. We're Orion, competing Robocup Junior team from Princeton, NJ, USA.

## Our team members: 
- Mark Ogata:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Electrical Specialist and Team Captain

- Keiji Imai:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Specialist

- Danil Korennykh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Lead Programmer

- Niklas Austermann:&nbsp; Vision Specialist

## Founding:
The team was established in [year] by Mark Ogata; Keiji Imai joined in 2016, competing in LEGO leagues. 

In 2019, the team took on Yota Nakamura, Mulin Huan and Oliver Cai, competing first in the national lightweight division and winning, then at the world level in Sydney. 
After that competition, the Princeton Soccer Robotics club was founded at Princeton High School, to enable other students to learn what we have learned at Robocup Junior competitions. 

## Lightweight 2019
The team resolved to build a winning robot for the 2020 competition; Yota, Mulin and Oliver left and were replaced with Niklas to enable the team to match others' camera systems and Danil to write more effective software as quickly as possible.

Over the course of late 2019 and the beginning of 2020, the team worked hard, iterating complete new designs four times to match and then exceed the innovations of the gold-standard teams at Sydney, adding all of the tools a robot needs to defeat enemies in competition. 

Then came the blow: 2020's competition was canceled first at the national and then international levels. Team Orion and some of the other Princeton teams competed in a local Robotics Design Competition, then in a Virtual Robocup competition. This wasn't enough, however. We had built two champion robots, and we intended to see them compete. So we continued, praying that 2021 would bring a real competition, pushing the design further and lightening the robot until we could fit in every critical lightweight-robot feature we could think of: 
- high-speed Maxon DCX19 brushed motors, 
- high-speed processing with the Teensy 4.1, 
- high-power ball control with a custom dribbler,
- high-power scoring with a Takaha solenoid and custom 70V boost circuit,
- high-traction, low-weight custom double-layered omniwheels,
- high-precision line detection with a custom "Koig Ring" sensor ring,
- high-precision goal awareness with an OpenMV Cam H7 and custom omnidirectional mirror.

Alas, travel and meetup restrictions had not eased enough for a real competition, so we had to make do with another virtual one, competing in a set of virtual challenges against teams from across the world after qualifying in nationals with our poster. This still didn't satisfy our need for a real competition, so we put our lightweight bots to the side and began design and development for a new set of robots for Open, since we're no longer eligible for lightweight, having competed twice. 

This website is here to document our journey, our design choices, and the innovations we've made. We hope you enjoy.
